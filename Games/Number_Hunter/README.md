## Number Hunter (Inspired by Metal Saga)
### Rules
#### Objective:
Given a 3 digit number, you have 5 chances to guess it correctly.
#### Example:
If the answer is 045  
For each guesses you submit, the following hint will be displayed:
1) If a digit is guessed correctly and it is in the correct position, it's a Hit!
> - 067, 1 Hit (Because 0 is correct and in the correct position)
> - 047, 2 Hit (Because both 0 and 4 is correct and in the correct position)
2) If a digit is guessed correctly but it is not in the correct position, it's a Blow!
> - 437, 1 Blow (Because 4 is correct but is not in the correct position)
> - 457, 2 Blow (Because both 4 and 5 is correct but not in the correct position)
> - 450, 3 Blow (Because all are correct but none are in the correct position)
3) If none of the three digits are correct, then it will display None.
4) If you guessed the correct number, then it will display Correct.
#### Note:
  All digits are distinct, so each digits will not be the same number.
