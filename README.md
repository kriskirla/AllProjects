# Current Progress:
- Translating Chakbot from C# to Python to enable multi-platform as well as use in conjunction with Raspberry Pi
- I have started learning circuitry with RPi3 and succesfully output messages to LCD display using python. Currently learning more and familarizing what I can do with RPi and how I can combine it with Chakbot.

# Future Projects:
- Actual Machine Learning. Currently Chakbot will only learn if you teach it, not really "learning" per se. This feature will be added as soon as I learn more about AI in university.
- Speech recognition. This makes talking with Chakbot possible instead of inputting with keyboard. 
- IOS App. As a mac user, of course that's a given. Why do you need this over Google Assistant and Siri? Well you don't, it's just for fun.

# Chakbot
This is a program that you can have a chat with (how it began).

Current features:
- Can teach Chakbot to respond to any given questions
- Encrypt/Decrypt Messages
- Translate Morse Code
- Calculate
- Unit Conversion
- Tell time

UI Features (Only on C#):
- Different Themes

This is still in progress, so if you want to play with it, head to the debug file inside of Chakbot and run the execution.

Nessessary Files:
- Chakbot.exe

Good to haves:
- brain.txt
- config.txt

If you start Chakbot without brain.txt, then Chakbot will not know how to answer anything (You will have to teach Chakbot from scratch.)

config.txt is only there to store personal preferences

# Other two programs
The other programs were created a few years ago, which inspired the functionalities of Chakbot.
