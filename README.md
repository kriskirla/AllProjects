# Current Progress:
- Completed Tic Tac Toe and Trivia (Currently has 70 questions across different categories. More will be added as time goes)
- When regression testing is completed, Chakbot will be tested on RPi3 to run on 16x2 LCD Display

# Future Projects:
- Actual Machine Learning. Currently Chakbot will only learn if you teach it, not really "learning" per se. This feature will be added as soon as I learn more about AI in university.
- Speech recognition. This makes talking with Chakbot possible instead of inputting with keyboard. 
- IOS and Android App. Why do you need this over Google Assistant and Siri? Well you don't, it's just for fun.

# Chakbot
This is a program that you can have a chat with (how it began).

Current features:
- Can teach Chakbot to respond to any given questions
- Encrypt/Decrypt Messages
- Play games
- Translate Morse Code
- Calculate
- Unit Conversion
- Tell time

There is not much UI for the Python Chakbot as it will be used for another project.

UI Features (Only on C#):
- Different Themes

![Chakbot: Machine learning in C#](https://github.com/kriskirla/AllProjects/blob/master/img/CSchakbot.PNG)

This is still in progress, so if you want to play with it, head to the debug file inside of Chakbot and run the execution.

# Instructions
For Python:
- Simply download the Chakbot_Python folder and execute Chakbot_Main.py
- You have to use Python 3 (It will not work with Python 2 and below)

Note:
If you start Chakbot without brain.txt, then Chakbot will not know how to answer anything (You will have to teach Chakbot from scratch.)

For C# (Not recommended as it is outdated):
- Download the debug folder (Chakbot/Chakbot/bin/Debug)
- Run Chakbot.exe within the debug folder

# Other two programs
The other programs were created a few years ago, which inspired the functionalities of Chakbot.
