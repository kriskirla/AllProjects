![Chakbot: Machine learning in C#](https://github.com/kriskirla/AllProjects/blob/master/chakbot.PNG)

This is still in progress, so if you want to play with it, head to the debug file inside of Chakbot and run the execution.

Nessessary Files:
- Chakbot.exe

Good to haves:
- brain.txt
- config.txt

If you start Chakbot without brain.txt, then Chakbot will not know how to answer anything (You will have to teach Chakbot from scratch.)

config.txt is only there to store personal preferences

# Current Progress:
- Importing Chakbot from C# to Python, this should be done in two weeks including testing.
- I have started learning circuitry with RPi3 and succesfully output messages to LCD display using python.

# Future Projects:
- Actual Machine Learning. Currently Chalbot will only learn if you teach it, not really "learning" per se. This feature will be added as soon as I learn more about AI in university.
- Speech recognition. This makes talking with Chakbot possible instead of inputting with keyboard
